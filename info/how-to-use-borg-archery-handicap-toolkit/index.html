        <h2 id="About">About</h2>

        <p>There are two main aims of this app:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To make it easy for you to determine if your shooting is improving which in turn gives you an incentive to keep shooting.</li>
            <li>To make shooting more enjoyable by giving you the option of turning any club session into an ad-hoc competition between yourself and your fellow archers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            One way to see if you are improving would be to shoot the same round over and over again and just compare the scores but that would be one sure way
            to get bored with the sport!
        </p>
        <p>
            By using this app you can shoot whatever round you like and still be able to determine if your shooting is improving. You don't
            even need to shoot an official Archery GB or World Archery round to determine how well you are shooting as the app also includes handicap information for two, three and four dozen practice rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike most archery handicap calculators, this app can also be used during the shoot to show you if you are still on track.
            And with the 2.0.0 release of this app it is also possible to run ad-hoc competitions with your fellow archers. It doesn't matter if your fellow archers are better or worse than yourself as the winning
            archer
            will be the one most improved and not necessarily the one with the highest score for the round. Now you can turn every club shoot into a competition!
            This app makes this possible through an extended use of the Archery GB handicap system devised by Mr. D. Lane.
        </p>

        <p>Many thanks to Mr. D. Lane for creating the handicap algorithm.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="HandicapSystem">The Handicap System</h2>

        <p>
            Archery GB handicaps range from 0 to 100. The lower the number the better. The handicap level of each round shot can be determined with this app.
            This value can then be compared to previous rounds shot to determine if you are improving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each archer, under the Archery GB system, will have a handicap rating. The lower the handicap rating the better the archer. You will have a handicap rating for
            each bow discipline that you shoot: recurve, compound, barebow, longbow...
        </p>

        <p>Having a handicap rating means that you can then take part in handicap shoots and make use of the competition functionality of this app.*</p>

        <p>For further information about the handicap system and to get your current Archery GB handicap rating please consult your club records officer. You can also find further information at: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.borgarchery.com/info/the-handicap-system">https://www.borgarchery.com/info/the-handicap-system</a></p>

        <p><strong>*</strong>If you and your fellow archers do not have official Archery GB handicap ratings and you would still like to make use of this app's competition functionality then
        you could use the Handicap screen to give yourselves makeshift handicap ratings: Determine the handicaps of your last three shoots. Add up all the values, divide by three and then round up to the next whole number.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="HowToUse">How to use</h2>

        <h3 id="Handicap">Handicap</h3>

        <p>
            You've just completed a round and want to see if you've improved:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>From the main screen press the 'Handicap' button.</li>
            <li>Select the round just shot using the second dropdown of the 'Round' section.
            <p>Note: You can limit the rounds shown by selecting the round type from the first dropdown of the 'Round' section or just leave it at 'All' to see all the rounds available.</p></li>

            <li>Enter your score for the round.</li>
            <li>
                Press the 'Calculate' button.

                <p>You will be presented with the handicap level for the shoot.</p>

                <p>
                    If the handicap shown is a lower number than your previous shoot then you have improved.
                    If it is a higher number then you haven't shot quite as well. If it is the same number then you are shooting at the same level.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="ScoreRequired">Score Required</h3>

        <p>
            Wouldn't it be useful if you could determine the score required prior to starting the shoot and track your progress during the shoot?:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>From the main screen press the 'Score' button.</li>
            <li>On the 'Score Required' screen select the round type and round you intend to shoot.</li>
            <li>Enter the handicap level you are trying to attain.</li>
            <li>
                Press the 'Calculate' button.

                <p>You will be presented with the score that you require for the shoot.</p>
                <p>This may be sufficient for your needs but if you want to view the breakdown of the round then:</p>
            </li>

            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    Press the 'Score Breakdown' button.

                    <p>
                        This will show you a breakdown of the round into ends. You can use this information during the shoot to determine if you are still on track.
                        If your actual score is the same or higher than that shown then you know you are on your way to achieving or bettering the handicap level.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If your score is less than that shown then you know you need to improve on the remaining ends.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>NEW in version 2.1.0:</strong> If you want the app to track your progress during the shoot then:
            </p>

            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    Press the 'Shoot Target Handicap' button.

                    <p>
                        If you have previously made use of the competition functionality then it will ask you whether you would like to modify archer # 1. Press 'Yes' to continue or 'No' to cancel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you haven't previously made use of the competition functionality then it will present you with the 'Comp.' screen. The
                        'Number of Archers' field will be set to 1 and the 'Target Handicap' field will be set to the chosen target handicap. All that remains is for you to set your current handicap
                        and / or decide whether you are also running an ad-hoc competition with your fellow archers. More information can be found in the 'Handicap Competition' section below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> For those shooting under Archery GB who want to improve their official handicap rating you must shoot an official round and improve on your current rating.
                        Generally you will want to set your target handicap to <u>at least two lower than</u> your current Archery GB handicap rating. This is
                        because your new handicap rating can only
                        improve if you shoot a better handicap and is the
                        average of your current handicap rating and the newly shot handicap rating.
                        e.g. If your handicap rating is 60 and you just shot a 58 then your new handicap rating has improved to 59 i.e. the mid point of 58 and 60 is 59.
                        If your handicap rating is 60 and you just shot a 59. Your new handicap rating does not change i.e. the midpoint of 59 and 60 is 59.5. Fractional handicap ratings are always rounded up to
                        the next whole number, in this case: 60.
                        If your handicap rating is 60 and you shot 60 or higher then your handicap rating stays the same.
                    </p>

        <p>
            Make shooting more fun by turning any club session into an ad-hoc handicap competition!
        <p>
        <p>
            The Handicap Competition functionality can be used in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#AdHocComp">Turn any club shoot into an ad-hoc handicap competition and/or track your progress against a target handicap</a></li>

        </p>

        <h4 id="AdHocComp">Turn any club shoot into an ad-hoc handicap competition and/or track your progress against a target handicap</h4>

        <p><u>Prior to the start of the shoot:</u></p>

        <ol>
            <li>From the main screen press the 'Comp.' button.</li>
            <li>On the 'Comp.' screen select the round you intend to shoot.</li>
            <p>Note: This will be the round that most (or all) of your fellow archers will be shooting.</p>
            <li>
                Enter the number of archers competing including yourself - maximum of 99. If you are just tracking your progress against a target handicap then set to 1.
                <p>If you want to also track your progress against a target handicap then:</p>

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Tick the 'Track my Progress' checkbox</li>
                    <li>Enter the target handicap level that you would like to attain in the shoot in the 'Target Handicap' field.</li>
                    <li>
                        Enter your current handicap level in the 'Current Handicap' field.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>

                </ol>

            </li>


            <li>
                Press the 'Edit Archers' button.

                <p>You will be presented with the 'Comp. Edit Archers' screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter the names and handicaps of all the archers. For speed, rather than selecting each field manually, select the first field and make use of the next field button on the on-screen keyboard. Note. The next field button symbol is dependent on keyboard / device.
            </li>
            <li>
                If any of the archers are shooting a different round (e.g. you may be shooting a round which has a compound bow alternative) then press the relevant 'Round' button.
                <p>This will display the 'Select Round' popup. Select the correct round and press the 'OK' button or press the 'Cancel' button to cancel round selection.</p>
                <p>You can add another archer by pressing the 'Add Archer' button (the new archer will appear at the bottom of the list) or delete an archer by pressing the relevant 'Delete' button.</p>
                <p>If you would like to set, change or clear your target handicap then press the 'Target Handicap' button alongside Archer # 1</p>
            <li>
                When all the data has been entered press the 'Enter Results' button.
                <p>You will be presented with the 'Comp. Enter Results' screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                The screen will default to entering the results for the first end. If you want to enter the results for the entire round then select the last end from the 'After End #' dropdown.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Note. You can amend the archer's names or handicaps, add an archer or delete an archer by pressing the menu in the top right and selecting the 'Edit Archers' item.
            This will take you back to the 'Comp. Edit Archers' screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note. Once a competition has been set up the app remembers this. If you press the 'Comp.' button on the main screen then it will take you to the correct screen based on your progress through the
            competition. So don't be afraid about closing the app, switching to a different app or looking up a person's handicap during the shoot.
        </p>


        <p><u>During the shoot (after each end or each two ends):</u></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Enter the running totals for each archer. Again, for speed, make use of the next field button on the on-screen keyboard.
                <p>Note. You are entering the <u>running totals</u> of <u>ALL</u> the ends shot so far and <u>NOT</u> the total just for that particular end.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the 'Results' button.
                <p>You will be presented with the 'Comp. Results' screen.</p>
                <p>If you are tracking your progress against a target handicap then this will be displayed in a section that is coloured red, amber or green:</p>
                <p>Red signifies that you aren't doing sufficiently to meet your target handicap. The negative value will show how many shots down you are.</p>
                <p>Yellow signifies that you are just meeting your target handicap.</p>
                <p>Green signifies that you are doing better than required to meet your target handicap. The positive value will show how many shots up you are.</p>
                <p>The next section will list the position of each of the archers in the competition. The person in the lead will be at the top.<p>
                <p>
                    Each archer's adjusted score will be displayed in either green (they are shooting better than their current handicap rating), grey (they are shooting to their current handicap rating) or red
                    (they are shooting worse than their current handicap rating).
                </p>
                <p>The number in brackets will show the number of points deviation from their handicap rating.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are scoring end by end then press the 'Next End' button. If you are scoring two ends at a time then press the 'Next Two Ends' button
            </li>
            <li>
                Shoot the next end (or next two ends). Repeat from step 1 of this section to enter the new running totals.

                <p>At the end of the shoot you will be presented with the final leaderboard.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!--
    <h4 id="TrackProgress">Track your progress during a shoot</h4>

    <p>If you are not shooting an ad-hoc competition then follow the steps in the <a href="#AdHocComp">Turn any club shoot into a ad-hoc handicap competition</a> section but with an archer number of 1 (yourself).</p>

    <p>If you want to improve your handicap rating then enter a handicap of your current handicap rating minus 2.</p>
    <p>After each end (or two ends) you will be presented with your adjusted score. A grey 'Adjusted Score' of 1440 means that you are shooting to the required handicap rating.
    A green score means that you are shooting above the required handicap rating - keep it up! The score in brackets shows how many points you have in hand.
    A red score means that you are shooting below the required handicap rating - try to improve on your remaining ends. The score in brackets shows how many points you need to catch up by.
    -->       
        <h4 id="OfficialComp">Official club handicap tournament</h4>

        <p>
            This can be used to greatly reduce the effort and time needed both to enter and get to the results of an official club handicap tournament. Don't keep your archers in suspense after the shoot - make the results
            available as quickly as possible.
        </p>

        <p>There is no need to look up and enter allowances for rounds. All you need is the archer's name, official current handicap (and possibly bow type for those rounds that have variations based on bow).

        <p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="#AdHocComp">Turn any club shoot into a ad-hoc handicap competition</a> section but:

        <p>Set the end number in the 'After End #' dropdown to the last end. Alternatively, to add a bit of excitement during the competition, you may want to enter the running totals at the end of each distance.</p>

        <p>
            We suggest that all archer config is done prior to or during the round in order to be able to get to the results as quickly as possible after the round is complete.
